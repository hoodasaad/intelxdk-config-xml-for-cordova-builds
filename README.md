intelxdk-config-xml-for-cordova-builds
======================================

This repo contains a sample of a basic `intelxdk.config.xml` file for use with the Intel XDK "Cordova for ..." Build targets (for versions 0876 and earlier). It is **_strongly advised_** that you edit this example to meet the needs of your app. Using it _as is_ will result in errors and unnecessary installation permissions for your app.

> NOTE: this file is not used if you are using Intel XDK versions 1199 or higher. In those versions of the Intel XDK a platform-specific version of this file is generated automatically via the information you provide on the Intel XDK Projects tab (see the Build Settings and related sections of that tab). The information in this file is useful for an intelxdk.config.additions.xml file, since all of the intelxdk.config.*.xml files used by the build system utilize the preferences and format shown here.
